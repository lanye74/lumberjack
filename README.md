## roadmap (approximately)

### 2.6.0
try to get app a bit cleaner
- rework toasts
- rescale UI?
- info panel in settings
	- app version, author (me), changelog
- pop up for reload on new app version
	- maybe cookie to store if the reload was clicked?
	- and then popup for "click here to see what's changed"?
	- in the future if i need closable modals, make sure to use shallow routing - push history so the native back button will close it
- perhaps: confetti on log submission?

### 2.7.0
make app even easier (and more invasive)
- create geofences in google maps and export them
	- (for auto detecting location client-side and server-side)
- record location on log submission
- reuse pop up from new app version

### 3.0.0
- log editor

### 4.0.0
- admins and admin data exports
- possibly graphs and stuff?

### 5.0.0
ui rework
- i don't know what this entails and it may be scrapped
- possibly chip away at idea of reworking view transitions?
	- i think my idea of rendering all pages at once and then sliding between them is really really bad but it could be funny
- this may actually be large enough for a major version
- perhaps use a UI library

### at some point
- switch to svelte 5
- add a page-by-page log input ui
- do more server calls on client-side maybe



## misc goals
- host supabase instance locally?
	- is this necessary?
- possibly bonus points for visiting underserved schools?
- bounties??
	- this would require an actual homepage instead of josh's "just throw the clock in on the front page"
- ranked splits xd (actually do it though)
- points --> themes
- profile borders???
	- discord cat ears border (real and true)
- stealing points?
- idk
