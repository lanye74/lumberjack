## goals new
- geolocation api attached to logs
	- auto-detect location and let them override
- time editor
- log editor
- host supabase instance locally?
	- is this necessary?
- admin panel to view/export statistics


## other ideas related to gamification
- possibly bonus points for visiting underserved schools?
- bounties??
	- this would require an actual homepage instead of josh's "just throw the clock in on the front page"
- ranked splits xd (actually do it though)
- points --> themes
- profile borders???
	- discord cat ears border (real and true)
- stealing points?
- confetti on submit
